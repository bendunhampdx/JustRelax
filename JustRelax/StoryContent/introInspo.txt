Hello August'ers~ 🌟
Welcome to the Epicodus Online Classroom here on Discord!
Classes are still in session for other cohorts, so please be mindful of where you post on the server.

❓ You have a designated #deleted-channel channel for reaching out with questions, please avoid chatting unnecessarily in this channel so that questions can be seen by instructors. Teachers are generally unavailable after hours and on the weekend unless there is a critical issue. Please reach out here for questions related to coding, for technical issues reach out in the #technical-difficulties channel.

💬 You also have a designated general channel (that's this one) for any chatting, general talk or coding related, that you might want to have as a class. Treat this space the same you would any professional environment, and remember to be respectful of others. You are also free to use the cafeteria voice channel in General for chatting together, except during your class times.

🕗 Orientation will begin at 8:15AM on Monday with your Coding Instructor James and Career Advisor Jasmine. It is very important to complete the pre-work before joining the class, so please alert one of them on Monday if you have not completed the pre-work by direct message on Discord, or by email.

@James Henager  james@epicodus.com - Coding Instructor
@Jasmine Pfau (she/her)  jasmine@epicodus.com - Career Advisor

It's also very important to realize that this bootcamp is designed to challenge those who have little to no experience with programming, so remember that it's alright to feel lost at times. This is part of the experience of impostor syndrome -- something you'll learn about throughout the program. 

We only ask that you act with good intention, to do your best, and remember that you are capable.
Happy coding August'ers, and again, welcome to Epicodus. 🙌

🥗 🍕 Lunch time is at Noon everyday @pdx-student It's very important to carve out time away from the screen so that you can stretch, hydrate, and eat. Taking care of yourself is critical to being a good developer and a good team member. 🥳 Keep up the hard work all. See you back in an hour at 1:00 pm PST, in the same voice channel with your same pair.
James Henager — 08/02/2021
Welcome back from lunch @pdx-student! We will be getting back into pair programming wherever you left off and finishing up our orientation later today at 4!
James Henager — 08/02/2021
@pdx-student Hey class, just a reminder that we will be joining up yet again for about an hour of orientation to close out the day at 4:00pm. You've got about 15 minutes to finish up what you're working on and commit/push your progress. I will see you all there at:  https://meet.google.com/vrp-mopk-ejy
