Intro Script:

Spames: Hello students! Welcome to  ~Spepicodus~ programming bootcamp!
Spames: My name is ~Spames~ and I will be your instructor for this course.
Spames: This bootcamp is designed to challenge those who have little to no experience with programming, so remember that it's alright to feel lost at times.
Spames: It can be hard to stay focused so I reccomend listening to background music as you code. This is my favorite coding music:

-press enter to start music [you can't do anything until you do]
-- insert ASCII lofi girl here


Spames: Part of the requirement to complete the course is to work with a pair at all times. Please introduce yourselves in the chat.
- Please tell us your name:
- Pronouns:
- Where are you from?
- What did you do before Spepicodus?
- What are some hobbies you enjoy?

You: Something with the answers you gave

<All NPCs introduce themselves>
NotDutyLew: Hi! I'm not duty Lew! I live in PDX and my pronouns are she/her. I love fishing (for compliments)! Before specicodus I was an explosives tester in death valley CA. After losing a limb or two.. I decided my talents would be better spent writing code. 

Spames: It's very important to pay attention to your mental health while coding. Taking care of yourself is critical to being a good developer and a good team member. Make sure to check in with yourself regularly.
Type: "How am I feeling" in the console to check your wellness levels.
Please type "How am I feeling" now:


##Game script:

Spames: Alright, it's time to find a partner. Before you begin working on your first project, complete an ice-breaker activity to get to know each other.

<All NPCs have their own ice breaker--or not>


NotDutyLew (she/her): Hey <name>! Do you want to pair?
[ NotDutyLew has requested to pair with you. Press enter to accept. ]
[ You're now paired with Duty Lew. ]
[ As your join the chat with NDL, something vaguely creepy happens]

NotDutyLew: How are you today?
<good> <bad> <ugle>

NotDutyLew: Looks like were supposed to do word association for the icebreaker today.
NotDutyLew: ummmm... so the first word is "coding". What's the first word that pops into your head?

you: <answer>

NotDutyLew: That's kinda weird dude...

NotDutyLew: Does that make any sense? I was distracted by the music Spames is having us listen to LOL

NotDutyLew: Looks like our project today is PIG LATIN Translator. I can host our liveshare, if you want.

[ Duty Lew has invited you to join her liveshare ]

[ Duty Lew: -15 WL ]

[ You Have Joined Duty Lew's Live Share ]

DutyLew: I'll read the prompt: "Pig Latin is a language game that involves adding imaginary endings to real English words. In this prompt, you'll create an application that turns words into Pig Latin."

But wait, what is "Away" in Pig Latin?
